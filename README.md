0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.

In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). When an element is “pushed” onto the stack, it becomes the first item that will be “popped” out of the stack. In order to reach the oldest entered item, you must pop all the previous items.
